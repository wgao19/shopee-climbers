# Welcome, Shopee Climbers

Shopee Climbers is an interest group sponsored by [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/). We climb on a weekly basis in a few indoor climbing gyms in Singapore.

## How to Climb with Us

We have a signup sheet shared internally. Schedule will be posted at least one week prior to each climb. Feel free to join the sheet and indicate that/where you want to climb.

On the day of climb, feel free to show up any time after the designated time. One of us will be checking you in. Though it is more fun to climb together so please try to come in early! We will be taking group photos, climbing videos, and fun candy shots for our most awesome IG: [shopee_climbers](https://www.instagram.com/shopee_climbers/).

If you are first timer, to the sport or to the gym, you are encouraged to come in at the beginning of the time. We will be coordinating gym orientation, security briefing, and warmup together.

### Q & A

- What is covered by Shopee?

> We're paying for your *day pass entry fee* for whichever gym we are going. If you have kids we will purchase an adult-kid pass.

- What do I need to pay?

Some gyms require a one-time instantiation fee ranging from $5 - $10.

> If you do not have climbing shoes, and harness for top-rope gyms, you need to pay for your own rental that ranges from $5 - $8.

- Can I bring friends?

> Absolutely! Friend(s) will pay multi pass price.

- What should I wear?

> Comfortable clothes that you do sports with. You need to stretch your arms and legs so prepare for that.

- I've never climbed before...

> That is no problem! Most of us (including our organizers!) did our first climb after we joined Shopee.
